This project allows you to read DDEX files into friendly Python data types. XML files are decoded using the PyXB
library.

Keep in mind that this is a fairly low level library that only aims at making DDEX files easier to read using Python. Some DDEX data structures expose lists containing only one element, and some value like UpdateIndicator are not cast as booleans.

Features
--------

* Open an XML file into a DDEX data structure generated by pyxb corresponding to the DDEX version.
* Parse this DDEX data structure into a Python dict.

Supported DDEX versions
-----------------------

* 3.82

Quickstart
----------

::

  from ddexreader import open_ddex, ddex_to_dict

  xml_path = '/path/to/my/ddex_file.xml'
  ddex = open_ddex(xml_path)
  ddex_dict = ddex_to_dict(ddex)

How to add more DDEX definitions
--------------------------------

1. Install pyxb on your system. (Currently using version 1.2.6 so should use it to avoid having compatibility issues with the current versions of ERN supported.)
2. pyxbgen -u [the url to the definition file]
3. Move these files to the correct ernXX folder under ddexreader
